Hiya,

Topic: Inter Process Communication (IPC) using FIFO
Compile: gcc file -o binary
Instructions to run:
  1. First, run the fifo_read binary (./fifo_read) to check if you receive anything.
     Expect some garbage value to show up.
  2. Then, run the fifo_write binary (./fifo_write) to create /tmp/utkarsh_fifo (a Named Pipe)
     file. And it also writes "Utkarsh Gupta" to it.
  3. Now, run the fifo_read binary (./fifo_read) again to receive the same text (Utkarsh Gupta).
     This should not yield any error now. And output the same text.
