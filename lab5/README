Hiya,

Topic: File transfer using TCP connection
Compile: gcc file -o binary
Instructions to run:
  1. First, run the recvfile binary (./recvfile) to start the server.
  2. Then, run the sendfile binary (./sendfile) along with the filepath and
     the IP address. Something like: ./sendfile ../foo 127.0.0.1
  3. At this point, you'd have sent the file "foo" from the client's side
     and would have been very well receieved by the server.
