Topic: Inter Process Communication (IPC)
Compile: gcc file -o binary
Instructions to run:
  1. First, run the msgrcv binary (./msgrcv) to check if you receive anything.
     Expect an error at this point.
  2. Then, run the msgsend binary (./msgsend) to initiate the queue and send
     the message. It's an hard-coded array of texts at the moment.
  3. Now, run the msgrcv binary (./msgrcv) again to receive the same array of
     texts. This should not yield any error now.
